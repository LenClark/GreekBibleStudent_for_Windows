In order to install version 1.1.0 of Greek Bible Student, download either
a) the msi file alone, or
b) both files.

If you only use the msi file, it should run by double clicking it (although I haven't tested this approach).

If you have downloaded both, run setup.exe.  You *must* have the msi file in the same directory.
