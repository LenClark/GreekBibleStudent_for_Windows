        General Information about Greek Bible Student (GBS) </span></h3>
    <p>The aim of Greek Bible Student is to provide you with a version of the
      Greek New Testament and the Septuagint with some tools for exploring it <em><strong>on
          your own computer</strong></em>, This means that you can use it even
      when the internet is not available. It also means that you can work at
      your computer's speed and not that of your internet connection. (Please
      see the final section, <em>Caveats and Compliments</em>, for a brief
      explanation of sources and acknowledgements.) </p>
    <p>We'll introduce you to the different parts of the application in detail
      later but let's get an overview now of what Bible Reader offers. It
      provides</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The text of both New Testament and the Septuagint, displayed for a
        selected chapter</li>
      <li>A parse window: simply by clicking and "Analysing" a word, you can get
        a grammatical analysis of that word;</li>
      <li>At the same time, it will also try to give you details of how the word
        was used (as provided by the Liddell &amp; Scott Intermediate lexicon);</li>
      <li>A search facility allows you to get a list of all the verse where the
        word is used, together with some additional sophistication in search
        criteria;</li>
      <li>A notes area: a feature that allows you to create, save and restore
        notes for each verse in the New Testament;</li>
      <li>A vocabulary utility that allows you to list words in a verse or
        chapter, categorising by part of speech. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, let's look at the application in more detail.</p>
    <h3 id="L61"><a id="mozTocId47705" class="mozTocH3"></a><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">2.
        A Brief Overview of what you see </span></h3>
    <p>When you first start the application, it will look something like this:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="001%20Startup.png" height="693" width="1186"></p>
    <p>Let's initially describe the different parts of this window in general
      terms. The top of the window (coloured green) is the main menu, that acts
      much like other Windows applications.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="002_General_Schematic.png" height="693" width="1186">
    </p>
    <p>The rest of the application window is divided into two areas, left and
      right. We have identified three sub-areas on the left:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A panel at the top of this left-hand pane (which we've coloured
        yellow) which we will call the <strong>Orientation Panel</strong>;</li>
      <li>The main, rose area which contains the text;</li>
      <li>A small area at the bottom (marked in brown) which will need
        additional explanation. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The blue area is really two additional panels with a variety of
      sub-sections that are mainly to do with presenting information that you
      ask for as you work on the text.</p>
    <p>Note also that the left side really has two distinct tabs (left
      uncoloured): one for the New Testament and the other for the Septuagint
      (LXX). The basic structure shown here is the same for both. </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId687452" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.1 The Orientation Panel</h4>
    <p align="center"><img src="002a_Orientation_Panel_left.PNG" height="399" width="852"></p>

    <p align="center"><img src="002c_Left_Pane.PNG" height="865" width="615"></p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId458578" class="mozTocH4"></a>2.3 The Right (Information)
      Area</h4>
    <table width="100%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="10" border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="002d_Right_Area.PNG" height="828" width="674"></td>
          <td>
            <p>The upper half of the pane contains a variety of panels that will
              provide the user with information. We will discuss each of these
              in more detail below.</p>
            <p>The bottom half contains a variety of utilities:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>An area in which you can record notes attached to a specific
                verse;</li>
              <li>Information relating to the lexicon used in the <strong>Lexical
                  Information</strong> area in the top half;</li>
              <li>An area to set up details for a search (where the results are
                displayed in the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane in the
                top half);</li>
              <li>An area where you can configure your vocabulary list (again,
                where the results are displayed in the top half). </li>
            </ol>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId734497" class="mozTocH3"></a><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">3
        The main Text Area</span></h3>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId884576" class="mozTocH4"></a>3.1 The Basics </h4>
    <p>It's pretty obvious what happens here.</p>
    <p>The New Testament (NT) text and the Septuagint (LXX) text are kept
      separate and are accessed through separate controls. So, to read the NT
      text, click on the first tab at the top of the text pane and to read the
      LXX text click on the second:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="003_Text_Tabs.png" height="338" width="587"> </p>
    <p>If you are reading the NT, you can change the book you are reading by
      selecting from the list in the <em><strong>Book</strong></em> list, in
      the <em>Orientation Panel</em>. Similarly, you can change the chapter by
      selecting from the <em><strong>Chapter</strong></em> list. Note that, if
      you change the book, it will automatically reset to the first chapter of
      that book.</p>
    <p>If you want to do the same for the LXX, you need to select the second tab
      - <strong>Septuagint (Old Testament)</strong> - and you will be presented
      with a very similar setup.</p>
    <p>In both cases, you can also select a specific verse from the relevant
      pull-down list but there will be no visible change. (We will talk about
      the purpose of the list of verses later.) </p>
    <p>If you have a note displayed for your current verse and you change this
      verse reference, that note will disappear from view. (Don't worry! It will
      be conserved.) Similarly, if the verse you change to already has a note,
      then this note will now be displayed. We'll talk about notes later. </p>
    <h4><a id="mozTocId889619" class="mozTocH4"></a>3.2 Some Additional Options</h4>
    <p>If you right click anywhere on the text area, a small menu will pop up:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="3d_Context_Menu.png" height="363" width="563"></p>
    <p>This gives you a number of options.</p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId674389" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.1 Copy Current Word to
      ...</h5>
    <p>Selecting this option will display a new dialog:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="3e_Copy_word_options.png" alt="Copy Word Options"
        height="226" width="676"> </p>
    <p>This dialog allows you to specify:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>whether to direct the copy to the clipboard (so that it can
        subsequently be pasted into the application of your choice) or to the
        currently active note;</li>
      <li>whether to include the reference in the copy or not; and</li>
      <li>whether to include accents in the copied text or not.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are doing quite a lot of copying, it could be annoying to be
      constantly presented with this dialog and have to check various radio
      buttons every time. So, we have also provided a checkbox that allows you
      to specify that any future copies <em>of words</em> will automatically
      have the same options - in which case, this dialog will not appear again.
      (We will explain later how you can cancel this automatic feature, so that
      you can specify different options.) In any case, these options will only
      apply to the current session of Greek Bible Student: when you next restart
      the application, you will be presented with this diaolog again, the first
      time you copy a word. </p>
    <p>If you select <em><strong>Memory</strong></em>, this will copy the
      currently selected word to the clipboard. This means that you can paste it
      into another application, such as a Word Processor. (If you're not sure
      how to paste into your application, check its help facility, look on
      Google or ask a friend.) </p>
    <p>When you right click to get the Context Menu, make sure that the mouse is
      over the specific result and word that you are interested in.</p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId556746" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.2 Copy Current Verse to
      ...</h5>
    <p>This operates in exactly the same way except that it will copy the whole
      verse rather than a specific word. Again, be careful that you position the
      mouse correctly. The first time you select this in any session you will be
      presented with the same dialog. This time, it will specifically relate to
      copying the verse rather than a specific word. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId766562" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.3 Copy Current Chapter
      to ...</h5>
    <p>Predictably, this does the same thing but for the whole chapter. This
      time, the position of the mouse is relatively unimportant. Once again, you
      will be able to select the same options from the dialog. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId17825" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.4 Copy Selected Text to
      ... </h5>
    <p>You can select a small amount of text by using a <strong>click and drag</strong>
      technique: click the left mouse of the button, as normal, at the place
      where you want to selection to start but hold the button down rather than
      letting go; then, while holding the button down, drag the mouse until it
      is over the place where you want the selection to finish; then let go.
      Once you have done this, you can right click anywhere in the text area and
      select the menu option to copy the selected text. As before, the same
      options are available and can be set from the dialog. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId550418" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.5 Double Click - A
      Warning</h5>
    <p>Normally, with any text, you can select a word using a <strong>double
        click</strong> - i.e. if you click the left mouse button twice in
      succession, the entire word can be highlighted. This action can even be
      extended to multiple words by doing the "double click", holding the button
      down after the second click and then dragging the mouse across the text
      you want to select. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to make this work
      correctly in GBS: for some reason, the Unicode script used for the Greek
      text wrongly reports the length of words and, occasionally, Windows thinks
      the word is longer than it is. This means, when you select a word by
      double clicking, it can highlight the beginning of the next word as well.
    </p>
    <p>As a result, we counsel you to avoid attempting to make a selection using
      double clicks. If you <em>do</em> use the double click method, watch out
      for errors in the extent of the selection. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId588603" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.6 Reset Copy Options </h5>
    <p>You can use this option to remove options that you previously selected.
      This menu option is greyed out if you haven't actually set any copy
      options yet. If you <em>have</em> set options for one or more copy menu
      options, the following dialog will be shown:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="3f_Reset_copy_options.png" alt="Reset Copy Options"
        height="254" width="521"> </p>
    <p align="left">In the example shown, the user has set options for copying
      words, whole chapters and selected text in the New Testament and for
      copying individual verses of the Septuagint. If you wanted, for example,
      to change the options you have chosen for copying entire chapters, simply
      deselect that check and click on <strong>OK</strong>. The next time you
      copy a chapter, you will be presented again with the earlier dialog. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId435687" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.7 Set Search Details</h5>
    <p>See section 6 below for more information on this option.</p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId319402" class="mozTocH5"></a>3.2.8 Analyse Word</h5>
    <p>See section 4 below for more about this. </p>
    <h3><a id="mozTocId39382" class="mozTocH3"></a>4 Analysis</h3>
    <p>This is a convenient diescription for the action of creating:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Parse details, and</li>
      <li>Lexical information for the selected word.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you right click on a word in the text area, you will see a small
      context menu pop up:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="004_Context_Menu.png" height="263" width="761"></p>
    <p>Then select <strong>Analyse Word </strong> from the resulting pop-up
      menu to obtain parsing details and lexical information for that word. You
      will see the parsing information on the right hand, top pane immediately:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="004b_Parse_info.PNG" height="290" width="742"> </p>
    <p>To see the dictionary definition, click on the <em><strong>Lexical
          Information</strong></em> tab:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="004c_Lexical_Info.png" height="520" width="860">
    </p>
    <p>The process of finding the word in the Liddell &amp; Scott lexicon is a
      little insecure so it's possible that you will get a message that makes it
      clear that the word could not be located. We apologise, if this occurs: it
      simply illustrates that, although the tool is useful, it does not replace
      the need for a decent commercial lexicon. You also need to be aware that
      the version of the lexicon used is a little old and does not reflect
      contemporary scholarship. </p>
    <p>Note: if you select multiple words, <strong>Greek Bible Student </strong>
      will provide a warning and will not be able to display the information.</p>
    <p>Note that parse details and lexical information will remain visible until
      you request a new analysis and that changing tabs does not erase data.</p>
    <h3 class="style1" id="L170"><a id="mozTocId565411" class="mozTocH3"></a>5
      History</h3>
    <p><strong>Greek Bible Student</strong> keeps a track of passages you have
      selected. If you want to return to a previous Book and Chapter, simply
      click on the little down arrow of the relevant <strong>History</strong>
      Combo Box:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="005_History.png" height="277" width="506"></p>
    <p> Then select the previously-used passage that you want. Obviously, if you
      want to reuse a LXX passage, you will need to select it from the <em><strong>History
          of LXXX access</strong></em> list. </p>
    <p>Although not strictlly history, you can also select the previous chapter
      by clicking on the left arrow as: <img src="004%20Previous.png" alt="" align="middle"
        height="45" width="102"> in the top, orientation bar, or the next
      chapter by clicking on the right arrow. (Of course, if you are currently
      referencing a LXX passage, the title will say <strong>LXX Chapter</strong>.)
      </p>
    <p>Note that the bottom right pane also includes a tab for <em><strong>Liddell
          &amp; Scott Appendices</strong></em>. If you click on this, you will
      see a series of tabs on the <em>bottom</em> of the pane as well. Each of
      these will display information found in the original lexicon. There is no
      intelligence in these pages but they are they so that you can check
      abbreviations and the like that you might find in the <em>Lexical
        Information</em>. </p>
    <h3 id="L191"><a id="mozTocId49763" class="mozTocH3"></a>6. Searching</h3>
    <p>If you click on the <em><strong>Search</strong></em> tab in the lower
      right pane, you will find a fairly busy pane which allows you to configure
      a search:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006_Search_Setup.PNG" height="296" width="608"></p>
    <p align="left">This will take quite a bit of unpacking and some time to get
      used to, but it is to be hoped that this will be a useful part of GBS. </p>
    <p align="left">Obviously, the word to search for must be entered into the
      first textbox: <em><strong>Search for the word</strong></em>. The
      question is: How do you type a Greek word into the box?</p>
    <p align="left">Probably the most useful mechanism requires a return to the
      text area. If you right click on a word in the text area, a context menu
      option allows you to copy that word into this box:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006b_Text_Search_Option.png" height="416" width="545">
    </p>
    <p align="left">If you select this menu option it will insert the selected
      word into the box. (You can't see it here but the word &#956;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962; was
      selected.) So, with the word in the textbox, simply click on the <em><strong>Perform
          Search</strong></em> button and GBS will look for all the occurrences
      in the NT <em>and</em> the LXX:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006c_Search_Results.PNG" height="634" width="617">
    </p>
    <p align="left">Notice the scroll bar to the right of the search results.
      This means that you can click on the light grey area below the "thumb" and
      scroll down a page for more results. Alternatively, you can "drag" the
      darker grey thumb (the small square) and drag down as much or as little as
      you want.</p>
    <p align="left">Notice also the message at the bottom of the results. This
      was created while it was performing the search and is a report on
      progress. Be patient: the application is scanning through a lot of text
      and can take a little while.</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId430445" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.1 Being
      selective about which books to search</h4>
    <p align="left">You can speed up the search if you exclude some books from
      the search criteria. This can be done in a number of ways:</p>
    <p align="left">a) <em>Specific books</em></p>
    <p align="left">If you click on one of the books in the listbox, it will be
      highlighted (or "selected"). If you click on a second book, that too will
      be selected <em>and</em> the first one will stay highlighted. You can
      scroll through the list of books and select specific ones:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006d_Selecting_Books.PNG" height="258" width="257">
    </p>
    <p align="left">If we now click on the <em><strong>Remove Selected Books</strong></em>,
      GBS will remove those books from the search criteria:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006e_Gone.PNG" height="260" width="260"></p>
    <p align="left">Look carefully and you will see that the three selected
      books are no longer in the list. Incidentally, if you clicked on a book in
      error and it was selected, simply click on it again and it will be
      un-selected,</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId271964" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.2 Excluding
      and including whole collections of books</h4>
    <p align="left">If I want to exclude whole groups of books, I can use the
      check boxes to the right of the book list. Imagine, for example, that I
      only want to search the New Testament. Then, I can simply deselect the
      checkboxes for each of the Old Testament categories and they will
      disappear from the list:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006f_Groups_Gone.PNG" height="259" width="261">
    </p>
    <p align="left">You may have noticed the two buttons above the book list:
      one says <em><strong>Use</strong></em> and the other says <em><strong>Omit</strong></em>.
      These are "radio buttons": clicking on one un-clicks the other; they are
      an either/or choice. Selecting <em><strong>Omit</strong></em> will
      effectively reverse the functioning of the tool: the checkboxes on the
      right will function in the opposite sense.</p>
    <p align="left"> So,clicking on the same three groups with <em><strong>Omit</strong></em>
      selected will then <em>remove</em> the NT books to the list:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006h_Include.PNG" height="264" width="266"></p>
    <p align="left"> You can return to the default state by clicking <em><strong>Reinstate
          Books to default settings</strong></em>.</p>
    <p align="left">So, using these simple selection tools, you can quickly and
      easily narrow your search criteria.</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId603504" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.3 Being even
      more specific</h4>
    <p align="left">To the left of the book list is an option that we have
      ignored up to now: <em><strong>All words with the same root</strong></em>.
      We have been searching all words with the same root. This will <em>not </em>search
      for both verbs and cognate nouns but will search for all variations of
      conjugations of a verb or declinations of a noun or adjective. If you
      really only want occurrences of <em>exactly</em> the word you entered in
      the Search box, then click on the radio button, <em><strong>Exact match</strong></em>:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006i_Exact_Match.PNG" height="622" width="609"></p>
    <p align="left">Compare the results here with those shown earlier. At first
      they look the same but, as you scan down, you will see that some are
      missing. These latest results show only the verses that show specifically
      &#956;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#963;&#943;&#945;&#962;.</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId287115" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.4 A second
      way of entering your search word</h4>
    <p align="left">In general, I have found the method described above as the
      most common method by far. However, there is a second way. If you look on
      the bottom left of the application window, you will see the button: <em><strong>Show
          Keyboard</strong>:</em></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006j_ShowKeyboard.png" height="227" width="547"></p>
    <p align="left">Click on this button and a virtual keyboard will be
      revealed:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006k_Virtual_Keyboard.png" height="452" width="571"></p>
    <p align="left">Anything you type will be entered into the textbox, <em><strong>Entered
          text</strong></em>. The radio buttons on the bottom will determine
      where the final word will go when you click on <em><strong>Use Word </strong></em>.
      The main benefit of this keyboard is that you can easily enter Greek text
      into your notes. However, you can also use this to populate your search
      option by selecting the <em><strong>Primary Search String</strong></em>
      radio button option. Now, when you type, the characters will be entered in
      the Search textbox.</p>
    <p align="left">Of course, you "type" using the mouse. These do <em>not</em>
      respond to keyboard presses. To get the accents, breathings iota subscript
      and the like, click on the relevant symbol first, then on the character
      that will bear it. If the addition is not allowed, it will simply be
      ignored. Note: if you're not sure of which key or symbol is which, hover
      the mouse over the key briefly and a "hint" will appear to tell you. </p>
    <p align="left">You may need to experiment with this option a little. You
      will also need to be careful that you have typed the word exactly.</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId459863" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.5 Secondary
      Search Criteria</h4>
    <p align="left">No doubt the hawk-eyed user has already noted several
      references to <em>Secondary Searches</em> and <em>Secondary Search
        Strings</em>. You can either redirect a second typed word by selecting
      the <em><strong>Secondary Search String</strong></em> radio button option
      on the virtual keyboard, or you can use another search option when you
      right click on a selected word in the text:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006l_Secondary_Search.png" height="433" width="672"></p>
    <p align="left">This will then modify the search area:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006m_Extra_Search_Stuff.PNG" height="295" width="607"></p>
    <p align="left">When you click on <em><strong>Perform Search </strong></em>
      you will now search for all occurrences of the <strong>primary</strong>
      word that occur within<strong> n </strong>words of the <strong>secondary</strong>
      word: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006n_Secondary_Results.PNG" height="628" width="615"></p>
    <p align="left">You will need to be very patient when using this option: the
      search process is a lot more complex and can take quite some time. If you
      perform a search that takes a long time, you should notice that a new
      button appears at the bottom of the setup area:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006n2_Stop_buttonf.PNG" alt="Stop Button" height="366"
        width="607"> </p>
    <p align="left">Clicking on this button will stop the search immediately.
      Some results found up to that point <em>may</em> be displayed. </p>
    <p align="left">You can vary the strictness or slackness of criteria by
      varying the "distance" of the two words, up to a separation of 10 words.
      It will be for you to judge how far the two words can be apart before
      there mutual occurrence becomes coincidental rather than significant.</p>
    <p align="left">Note also that this search can return matches across two or
      even three verses. (In fact, in extreme, it could be up to 5 (very short)
      verses. This explains why some results will look a bit ungainly and have
      two verses without a break between them. All the other utilities (root
      exact; excluding or including books or groups of books) work in the same
      way. </p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId165759" class="mozTocH4"></a>6.6 Using the
      Search Results</h4>
    <p align="left">These search results are primarily for your information.
      They form a kind of concordance. However, you can also make use of them.
      Right click on any specific result and you will see the following <strong>Context
        Menu</strong>: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="006o_Additional_Options.png" height="352" width="613"></p>
    <h5 align="left"><a id="mozTocId4746" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.6.1 Copy
      Results to ...</h5>
    <p align="center"><img src="006p_Copy_Options.png" height="283" width="660"></p>
    <p align="left">You will see that this will allow you to copy <em>all</em>
      the search results to either memory or to the currently active notes area.</p>
    <p align="left">If you copy this information to memory, you will then be
      able to paste it into another application, such as a Word Processor. You
      will use your normal <strong>paste</strong> mechanism. (If you're not
      sure how to use paste, check it out on Google or take advice.)</p>
    <p align="left">Remember that, if you copy it to the notes area, it will be
      active in the note for the currently selected verse.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><a id="mozTocId370851" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.6.2 Copy
      Single Result to ...</h5>
    <p align="left">This looks and acts pretty much the same except that it is
      selective: it will only copy the entry that you clicked on. This means
      that you will need to be careful where you right click.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><a id="mozTocId787900" class="mozTocH5"></a>6.6.3 Change
      Text to Selected Chapter</h5>
    <p align="left">Again, you need to be careful where you click for this
      option. It will change the book and chapter in the <em>left</em> (Text)
      pane to that of the result. So, for example, if you select this option on
      the result for <strong>Matthew 6:9</strong>, it will change the text
      presented in the left pane to Matthew 6. Note: if the New Testament is
      currently displayed and you click on a LXX result, the LXX pane will be
      changed but will not automatically be visible. The same is true the other
      way round. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a id="mozTocId413291" class="mozTocH3"></a>7. Vocabulary
      Lists</h3>
    <p align="left">GBS allows you to create vocab lists for a specific chapter
      or verse. To do this, click on the <em><strong>Set up Vocabulary</strong></em>
      tab in the bottom half of the right hand pane:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="007_Vocab_Set+up.png" height="375" width="648">
    </p>
    <p align="left">You can set up various options much as described for the
      Search facility.</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId343118" class="mozTocH4"></a>7.1 List vocab
      for ...</h4>
    <p align="left">You can create a vocab list for either a single verse (<em><strong>the
          current verse</strong></em>) or for the whole chapter (<em><strong>the
          entire current chapter</strong></em>). If you opt for the verse, make
      sure that the verse you are interested in is correctly set in the correct
      pull-down list in the <em><strong>Orientation Panel</strong></em> at the
      top of the window. For both options, make sure that the correct text is
      active (NT or LXX).</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId46754" class="mozTocH4"></a>7.2 Select
      specific types of words</h4>
    <p align="left">This is not an either/or choice: you can check or uncheck as
      many grammatical categories as you want. So, for example, if you are only
      interested in Nouns, make sure that there is a tick in the <em><strong>Nouns</strong></em>
      box and all others are left blank. As another example, if you want both
      adjectives and adverbs but nothing else, then ensure that the two boxes, <em><strong>Adjectives</strong></em>
      and <em><strong>Adverbs</strong></em> are ticked and nothing else.</p>
    <p align="left">As the note beside the check boxes says, if you leave
      everything blank, then <em>all</em> words will be listed.</p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId307031" class="mozTocH4"></a>7.3 Display
      vocabulary</h4>
    <p align="left">This is probably best described by showing you examples.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><a id="mozTocId734907" class="mozTocH5"></a>7.3.1 By type
      and alphabetically</h5>
    <p align="center"><img src="007b_example1.PNG" height="592" width="609"></p>
    <p align="left">Note that we have limited the choice to a single verse and
      just nouns, verbs and adjectives. The same option for the entire chapter
      would provide a fuller list:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="007c_example2.PNG" height="590" width="615"> </p>
    <p align="left">Obviously, there was too much to show everything and we can
      only see the first page's-worth. (We have used a different passage -
      Galatians 4 - because there are too many personal names in Matthew 1.)</p>
    <p align="left">See, the list is seperated into one list for nouns, another
      for verbs and so on. Within each category, they are listed alphabetically.</p>
    <h5 align="left"><a id="mozTocId843791" class="mozTocH5"></a>7.3.2 By type
      and order of use</h5>
    <p align="center"><img src="007d_example_3.PNG" height="579" width="615"></p>
    <p align="left">Compare this with the first image in the previous
      sub-section. It looks almost the same but the order of words is different.
      In this case, they are presented in the sequence in which they occur.</p>
    <p align="left">You can create similar lists for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mixed (i.e. both ordered by part of speech) but in alphabetical order;
      </li>
      <li>Mixed and in order of use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 align="left"><a id="mozTocId378509" class="mozTocH5"></a>7.3.3 Making
      the list from either the words used or their roots</h5>
    <p align="left">You can also choose (from the last set of options) whether
      to list the actual words used in the verse or chapter involved, or to use
      their roots. All previous examples have shown roots but here we show the
      specific words used in the verse: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="007e_example_4.PNG" height="585" width="616"></p>

    <p align="left">This is the first tab in the area at the bottom right of the
      window:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="008_Notes.PNG" height="410" width="674"></p>
    <p align="left">This is an area where you can simply make notes about a
      given verse. Each verse has its own notes area and, when you change to a
      different verse (whether in the same chapter or elsewhere), the note will
      disappear and, if the new destination already has a note, the new note
      will appear. So, if you change something and the note disappears, don't be
      too worried: moving back to the original verse should restore the note as
      well.</p>
    <p align="left">We will learn more about notes in section 9.2 below. </p>
    <h3 align="left"><a id="mozTocId269972" class="mozTocH3"></a>9. The Main
      Menu - File option</h3>
    <p align="left">The main menu is found at the top of the application window,
      in the <em><strong>Orientation Panel</strong></em>:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009_File_Options.png" height="259" width="556"></p>
    <h4 align="left"><a id="mozTocId428286" class="mozTocH4"></a>9.1 Preferences</h4>
    <p align="left">Clicking on this option will open a new mini-window (known
      as a <em><strong>dialog</strong></em> - note American spelling):</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009b_Preferences_Dialog.PNG" height="449" width="990">
    </p>
    <p align="left">Each tab along the top of this dialog represents one of the
      areas in which text occurs: the two panes of biblical text (NT and LXX),
      the analysis panes, the search results, the vocab lists and the notes
      area. Clicking on each tab will result in a presentation that is almost
      the same. For each area, this dialog allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>change the font itself, the fontsize and the font "style" (regular,
        bold, italics, etc.);</li>
      <li>change the colour of the text;</li>
      <li>change the background colour.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This might seem a little unnecessary but some people find black-on-white
      uncomfortable and changing colours may make it easy to use the application
      for long periods of time. (There is some suggestion that symptoms of
      dyslexia are eased when changing colours.) As a person of more mature
      years, the ability to increase text size also has significant benefits.
      Add to this that having different background colours may help distinguish
      the different areas and the feature could prove quite useful.</p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId312658" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.1.1 Changing font details
    </h5>
    <p>To change any of the font's characteristics, click on the<em><strong>Modify</strong></em>
      button of <em>Font details</em>. This will open a standard Windows font
      dialog:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009d_Font_Size.PNG" height="624" width="1138"></p>
    <p align="left">Once you have made your selection, the changes will be
      visible in the example text area on the right:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009e_Font_Completed.PNG" height="479" width="990">
    </p>
    <p>(Compare this image with the previous one.) Note that, although you have
      changed the font size for the lexical information area, you haven't
      changed the other areas. You could have a font size of 16 for the lexicon
      text, 14 for search results and 12 for everything else. Note also that you
      haven't actually changed anything until you click on the <em><strong>OK</strong></em>
      button.</p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId79126" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.1.2 Text colour</h5>
    <p>When you click on the <em><strong>Text Colour</strong></em> rectangle, a
      colour picker dialog opens:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009f_Colour_Picker.png" height="639" width="1081"></p>
    <p>From that point onwards, it should be obvious what you need to do. There
      are various levels of complexity to the colour picker and it is
      recommended that you experiment with it - but you can simply use the
      preset colours. For example, selecting yellow: </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009g_Text_Coloured.PNG" height="449" width="990"></p>
    <p align="left">(Not the most helpful of colours, perhaps.) Note that the
      preferences for the Search area add two additional colours:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009x_SearchArea_Preferences.PNG" alt="Search Area Preferences"
        height="449" width="990"></p>
    <p align="left">These mark the primary and, for more complex searches,
      secondary words in each matched quotation. You can change the colours for
      these in the same way as before. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId388971" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.1.3 Background colour </h5>
    <p>Wow! That looks awful! But let's change the background to red:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009h_Background_Coloured.PNG" height="449" width="990"></p>
    <p>That's not so bad, now ... although it's all a matter of taste. </p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId931751" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.1.4 Cancelling and
      activating</h5>
    <p>You can change some or all of the areas in a single session. If you are
      uncomfortable with your changes, simply click on <em><strong>Cancel</strong></em>
      and no changes will be made. Once you have changed the areas to your
      satisfaction, click <em><strong>OK</strong></em> and the changes will be
      activated. To show its effects, look at the changes we have made to the <em><strong>lexical
          information</strong></em> area but to no other panes:</p>

    <h4><a id="mozTocId791917" class="mozTocH4"></a>9.2 Managing Notes</h4>
    <p>We've talked about the notes but we need to look at additional facilities
      that are provided in managing notes.</p>
    <p>Each verse can have a note attached to it. We collect all the notes
      together to form a <strong>Note Set</strong>. GBS allows you to have more
      than one Note Set but you can only have one Note Set active at any one
      time.</p>
    <p>Out of the box, GNS comes with a single Note Set called <em><strong>default</strong></em>.
      Additional menu options under the <em><strong>Manage Notes</strong></em>
      option allows you modify your use of notes:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009_File_Options.png" height="259" width="556"></p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId905254" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.2.1 Create a New Note Set</h5>
    <p>Selecting this option will open a dialog to allow you to create a new
      Note Set:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009k_Create_Note_Set.png" height="316" width="578"></p>
    <p>You'll see that I've given the new Note Set a name. All I now have to do
      is <em><strong>OK</strong></em> it.</p>
    <p>This not only creates the new Note Set but changes the currently active
      Set to this new one. You can check this out by looking at the tab in the
      bottom right area of the application:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009l_Activated.png" height="231" width="394"></p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId153530" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.2.2 Choose a different
      Note Set</h5>
    <p align="center"><img src="009m_ChangeNote_Set.PNG" height="173" width="421"></p>
    <p>The currently active Note Set is lower down the dialog, in red. The
      listbox gives you a list of all other Note Sets that are available.
      (Notice that we have created an additional one called <strong>New Test</strong>.)
      Select the one you want and click <em><strong>OK</strong></em> and your
      Note Set will be changed.</p>
    <h5><a id="mozTocId903448" class="mozTocH5"></a>9.2.3 Delete an existing
      Note Set</h5>
    <p>This is a logical complement to the other tasks and functions pretty much
      as you'd expect:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="009n_Delete_Note_Set.PNG" height="173" width="421"></p>
    <p>Note that the current Note Set is <em>not</em> included in the list that
      can be deleted. If you want to delete the current set, you must change to
      another Set first. The logical consequence of this is that you must always
      have at least one Note Set within GBS. (If you are enterprising and manage
      to delete all note sets outside the application, GBS will create a new,
      empty Note Set called <em><strong>default</strong></em> next time you run
      the application.</p>
    <p>Beware: deleting the note set will destroy any data you have created
      within that set.</p>

      Relocate Application Files</h5>
    <p>The application depends on a number of files. These include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The text source for both NT and LXX;</li>
      <li>The contents of the Liddell and Scott lexicon, including appendices;</li>
      <li>Any notes you currently have stored;</li>
      <li>This help file and associated images;</li>
      <li>A variety of miscellaneous files that provide additional information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By default, these are stored in an obscure user area. You may want to
      move them to somewhere more accessible for any one of a variety of
      reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>to a location that is easier to access, allowing copying and/or
        pasting of Notes Sets;</li>
      <li>to a completely different hard disk, saving some space on your root
        disk.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This option allows you to make that relocation.</p>

      option can be found in relevant Context Menus and have been discussed
      previously, so we won't go over them again here. This simply means that
      you have an alternative location for some functions (although the
      population of Primary and Secondary Search data has been moved to the <em><strong>Search

    <h3 class="style1"><a id="mozTocId439754" class="mozTocH3"></a>12 Additional
      Information about the Main Window</h3>
    <h4 class="style1" id="L193"><a id="mozTocId784541" class="mozTocH4"></a>12.1
      Getting the Window the way you want it</h4>
    <p>You can resize the window by dragging the window edges or corners in any
      desired direction. We will assume that you are familiar with resizing
      windows (and click-and-drag actions, in particular) and, if you are not,
      we recommend that you read a book on using your operating system.</p>
    <p>The advantages of making the window bigger are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The main text may be easier to read;</li>
      <li>You will see more of the text if the chapter is a long one;</li>
      <li>It may make many of the text boxes and buttons less cluttered and
        easier to use.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The advantages of a smaller window may be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That the application better fits a small screen;</li>
      <li>You may wish to have other applications open at the same time and this
        makes it easier to navigate around your estate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What is important about the resizing of your window is that GBS will
      remember your settings and return the window to the same size next time
      you use the program.</p>
    <p>The window is divided into two halves and, between the main text area and
      the collection of small panes on the right hand side, there is a <strong>Splitter
        Bar</strong>. Slowly move your mouse from the main text area across to
      the right and, as you cross the divider, the cursor shape should change:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="13b_Hoz_Splitter.png" alt="Hosrizontal Splitter Bar"
        height="571" width="961"></p>
    <p> At the point the curser has changed you can click and drag the bar with
      your mouse. The benefit of this change is that you can maximise the area
      in which you have main interest.</p>
    <p>The application will remember the relative sizes of the two halves of the
      window as well when you return to the application.</p>
    <h4 class="style1" id="L227"><a id="mozTocId385119" class="mozTocH4"></a>13
      Adjusting the right-hand Pane</h4>
    <p>The one menu optionthat we haven't discussed is the pull-down list on the
      extreme right:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="13_Equalise.PNG" height="216" width="455"></p>
    <p>The purpose of this feature is to enable you to easily manage the
      information in the various sections on the right-hand side of the
      application. Sometimes you may want to concentrate on information in the
      top panel (e.g. Search Results) and at other times you may want to focus
      on the lower panel (e.g. if creating a complex note). This feature will
      enable you to resize these sub-panels in a controlled fashion.</p>
    <p>The options availabel are:</p>
    <h4 class="style1" id="L690"><a id="mozTocId662531" class="mozTocH4"></a>13.1
      Minimise Bottom</h4>
    <p>In other words, reduce the bottom panel to an absolute minimum and allow
      you to focus on the top panel. To use this option, simply click on the
      down arrow beside the Resize control and select the <strong>Minimise
        Bottom</strong> option:</p>
    <h4 class="style1" id="L700"><a id="mozTocId360131" class="mozTocH4"></a>13.2
      Minimise Top</h4>
    <p>This has a similar effect but works in the other direction.</p>
    <h4 class="style1" id="L704"><a id="mozTocId476536" class="mozTocH4"></a>13.3
      Equalise Both</h4>
    <p>This will restore the dividing bar between the two sub-panels to the
      mid-point vertically. This means that both the top and bottom panel on the
      right hand side will be roughly the same size.</p>
    <p>You are still able to resize these panels manually by clicking on the <strong>Splitter
        Bar</strong> and dragging it into the desired position:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="13_Splitter.png" height="494" width="406"></p>
    <h3 class="style1" id="L718"><a id="mozTocId350631" class="mozTocH3"></a>14.
      Caveats and Compliments</h3>
    <p>The text of the NT used in this application seems to be based on the
      transliterated version developped by CCAT (the Center for Computer
      Analysis of Texts) and is (or, at least, was) part of <a href="https://home.www.upenn.edu/"
        target="_blank">the University of Pennsylvania</a>. This seems to have
      been developed by <a href="https://www.sbl-site.org/" target="_blank">the
        Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta, Georgia</a> (with links to <a
        href="https://www.logos.com/">Logos Software</a>) and additional thanks
      go to <a href="http://jtauber.com/" target="_blank">James Tauber</a> who
      has made many corrections to the original parsing of the Gk NT. It has to
      be said that the nature of computer analysis of the NT text has become
      quite extensive and it's difficult to be sure that adequate
      acknowledgements have been made, so this includes an apology if we have
      failed to give adequate credit where credit is due.</p>
    <p>The text seems to be essentially that of Westcott and Hort (although,
      don't hold us to that) and this means that the text, as displayed, will
      vary from the latest versions produced by the <a href="https://www.unitedbiblesocieties.org/"
        target="_blank">United Bible Society</a> (and the <a href="https://www.die-bibel.de/en/shop/detail/index/sArticle/3043340/sCategory/3061203"
        target="_blank">current version [version 28]</a> is certainly
      recommended). In other words, this does <em>not</em> replace the need for
      a decent printed version of the Greek text.</p>
    <p>The version of the LXX used also seems to have originated from CCAT
      (which, in turn, is based on the Rahlfs text) but some modifications were
      facilitated from a member of a Classical Greek forum and, sadly, we did
      not note his name or details at the time and are unable to make adequate
      acknowledgements. It is with sorrow that we admit this.</p>
    <p>Because the path to the final versions of both NT and LXX have been long
      and convoluted, there is every probability that the data contains errors.
      We apologise for this and counsel caution in using the application: where
      conclusions are significant, check your facts carefully. But, then, you
      should do this anyway! Despite these words of caution, we think the
      benefits of using the software still outweigh the problems. </p>
