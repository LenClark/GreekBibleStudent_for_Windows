CONTENT

This data has been put together from a variety of sources.

The parsing codes have been taken from Tauber's data (see http://jtauber.com/morphgnt/), based on CCAT source.

The unique identifier has been calculated based on coding information provided in the source data (described below) and the text with accents removed and breathings removed have been provided by me.
