<h3><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">1 General
  Information about Bible Reader<a name="A1"></a></span></h3>
<p>The aim of Bible Reader is to provide you with a version of the Greek New
Testament and some tools for exploring it <em><strong>on your own
computer</strong></em>, This means that you can use it even when the internet
is not available. It also means that you can work at your computer's speed and
not that of your internet connection.</p>

<p>We'll introduce you to the different parts of the application in detail
later but let's get an overview now of what Bible Reader offers. It provides</p>
<ul>
  <li>The New Testament text, displayed for a selected chapter</li>
  <li>A parse window: simply by clicking and "Analysing" a word, you can get a
    grammatical analysis of that word;</li>
  <li>At the same time, it will also try to give you details of how the word
    was used (as provided by the Liddell &amp; Scott Intermediate lexicon);</li>
  <li>A search facility allows you to get a list of all the verse where the
    word is used, together with some additional sophisitcation in search
    criteria;</li>
  <li>It also provides a feature that allows you to create, save and restore
    notes for each verse in the New Testament.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's look at the application in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="L61"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">2. The New
Testament Text<a name="A2"></a></span></h3>

<p>When you first start the application, it will look something like this:</p>

<p><img
src="001%20Startup.png" width="1060" height="739" /></p>

<p>Let's describe the different parts of this window:</p>

<p><img alt="Explanation" src="002 Areas of startup screen.png" width="703"
height="527" /></p>

<h4 id="L76"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">2.1 The main
Text Area<a name="A2_1"></a></span></h4>

<p>It's pretty obvious what happens here.</p>

<p>We need to point out that the text is based on a version that is available
in the public domain (based on the text provided by the Society of Biblical
Literature - <em>home site: <a
href="https://www.sbl-site.org">https://www.sbl-site.org</a></em> - and Logos
Bible Software - <em>h</em><em>ome site:<a
href="https://www.logos.com">https://www.logos.com</a></em> - see <a
href="http://sblgnt.com">http://sblgnt.com</a>), together with the parsing
information. This has a number of implications:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The text is essentially based on Westcott &amp; Hort and may therefore
    display some differences from published versions of the Greek New
    Testament. (Note: for those who are wedded to the Textus Receptus, this
    <em>is</em> a critical text.) Where differences occur, they are often
    simply questions of variant readings.</li>
  <li>Since the parsing has been a labour of love by James Tauber (<a
    href="http://jktauber.com">http://jktauber.com</a>, see also <a
    href="http://jtauber.com">http://jtauber.com</a>), there could be errors -
    and, anyway, all parsing is likely to involve a degree of interpretation
    where there are any complications and we can never abdicate from our own
    responsibiity to engage with the text.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you click on a verse in the text area, the pull-down Verse list will
change to make that the current verse (of which, more later).</p>

<h4 id="L118"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">2.2
Selection of Book and Chapter<a name="A2_2"></a></span></h4>

<p>The first to "Combo Boxes" at the top of the window allow you to select
specific books of the bible and a specific chapter within the selected book.
When you select a different book from the one currently displayed, it will take
you to the first chapter of the new book.</p>

<h4 id="L123"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">2.3 Selection of Verse<a name="A2_3"></a></span></h4>

<p>The third Combo Box allows you to change the current verse. This doesn't
actually change anything visually but the significance is for the creation of
notes: any note you create will apply specifically to the verse referenced by
this Combo Box.</p>

<p>If you have a note displayed for your current verse and you change this
verse reference, that note will disappear from view. (Don't worry! It will be
conserved.) Similarly, if the verse you change to already has a note, then this
note will now be displayed.</p>

<p>You can change the verse reference by selecting your target verse in this
Combo Box or by clicking on the verse in the main text area.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L131">2.4 The Notes Area<a name="A2_4"></a></h4>

<p>Any notes you create (or install) will be displayed in the area at the
bottom half of the right hand side. If you want to create a note for a specific
verse, type your note here. If you want to add Greek text to any part of your
note, you can click on the <strong>Show Keyboard</strong> button to display a
keyboard that will allow you to do so. (Of course, you can use multiple
Microsoft keyboards to do the same thing, but it is difficult to create
suitable accents and diacritics using provided keyboards.)</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L138">2.5 Analysis<a name="A2_5"></a></h4>

<p>This is a convenient diescription for the action of creating:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parse details, and</li>
  <li>lexical information for the selected word.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, you only need to right click on a word
and then select <strong>Analyse</strong> from the resulting pop-up menu to obtain parsing details
and lexical information for that word. </p>

<p>Note: if you select multiple words, <strong>Bible Reader</strong> will
provide a warning and will not be able to display the information.</p>

<p>The parsing details will be provided in the area in the top half of the
right hand side. If you want to see the lexical information, you will need to
click on the tab entitled <strong>Lexical Information</strong>.  Note also that parse
details and lexical information will remain available until you request a new
analysis and that changing tabs does not erase data.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L170">2.6 History<a name="A2_6"></a></h4>

<p>Bible Reader keeps a track of passages you have selected. If you want to
return to a previous Book and Chapter, simply click on the little down arrow of
the <strong>History</strong> Combo Box <img
src="003 down arrow.png" alt="Down arrow" width="43" height="37" align="middle" /> and  select the passage you want.</p>

<p>Although not strictlly history, you can also select the previous chapter by
clicking on the left arrow <img src="004 Previous.png" alt="" width="67"
height="58" align="middle" /> or the next chapter by clicking on the right arrow <img
src="005 Next.png" alt="" width="57" height="58" align="middle" /> .</p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L191">3 Additional Information about the Main Window<a name="A3"></a></h3>

<h4 class="style1" id="L193">3.1 Getting the Window the way you want it<a name="A3_1"></a></h4>

<p>You can resize the window by dragging the window edges or corners in any
desired direction. We will assume that you are familiar with resizing windows
(and click-and-drag actions, in particular) and, if you are not, we recommend
that you read a book on using your operating system:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="008 Resized Window.png" width="960" height="572" /></p>

<p>The advantages of making the window bigger are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main text may be easier to read;</li>
  <li>You will see more of the text if the chapter is a long one;</li>
  <li>It may make many of the text boxes and buttons less cluttered and easier
    to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantages of a smaller window may be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>That the application better fits a small screen;</li>
  <li>You may wish to have other applications open at the same time and this
    makes it easier to navigate around your estate.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is important about the resizing of your window is that Bible Reader
will remember your settings and return the window to the same size next time
you use the program.</p>

<p>The window is divided into two halves and, between the main text area and
the collection of small panes on the right hand side, there is a Splitter Bar.
Slowly move your mouse from the main text area across to the right and, as you
cross the divider, the cursor shape should change. At the point the curser has
changed you can click and drag the bar with your mouse. The benefit of this
change is that you can maximise the area in which you have main interest.</p>

<p>The application will remember the relative sizes of the two halves of the
window as well when you return to the application.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L227">3.2 Data used by Bible Reader and Relocation<a name="A3_2"></a></h4>

<p>The application depends on data in four directories (or folders) and it is
probably worthwhile your knowing this. Immediately after installation, all four
folders will be found in the directory:</p>

<p>C:\Users\<em>yourUserName</em>\AppData\Local\NTReader</p>

<p>where yourUserName is the name you registered when you set up your computer.
(If someone else manages your computer, talk to him or her about this location
and how you can find it.) These files and folders have been placed in an area
for which you alone are responsible.</p>

<h5>a) <em><strong>Configuration<a name="A3_2_1"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>Default initialisation data (such as the
positions and sizes of the window and Splitter that we have just mentioned) will be stored in the Registry.</p>

<h5>b) <em><strong>Source<a name="A3_2_2"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>This directory contains most of the data that the application uses. This
includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the source files for the New Testament text;</li>
  <li>the Liddell &amp; Scott lexicon;</li>
  <li>various files supporting the lexicon that we have yet to discuss;</li>
  <li>other files that help manage and control the functioning of the
    application.</li>
</ul>

<h5>c) <em><strong>Notes<a name="A3_2_3"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>This is where your notes are stored. By default, your notes will be stored in a folder called
<em><strong>default</strong></em> but we will explain in a moment how you
can change this name and store muliple, separate sets of notes.</p>

<p>It is vital that you do not try to edit these files directly. If you do so, you may
completely lose your notes.</p>

<h5>d) <em><strong>Help<a name="A3_2_4"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>This file and associated images.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L285">3.3 Changing the Location of your Source Files, Notes and the Help files <a name="A3_3"></a></h4>

<p>It is possible to change the location of your source files. This is probably
only of value if you have multiple hard disks on your computer system and want
to save space on your default drive.</p>

<p>To make this change, select the following option from the application menu
(at the top of the computer screen):</p>

<p align="center"><strong>	File | Change Location of Application Files</strong></p>

<p>Selecting this option will open a small dialog that will allow you to navigate to the place on your disk where you want to store the data: </p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="009 Relocate Source Directory Dialog.png" width="325"
height="408" /></p>

<p>Choose the new location (i.e. the directory where you want the Source folder
to go). Note that Bible Reader will move the <strong>Source</strong> folder
itself, as well as all the files it contains, so you do not need to create a
folder called "Source" or &quot;Help&quot; or &quot;Notes&quot; . You can create any other directory you need by clicking
on the <strong>New Folder</strong> button and following directions.</p>

<p>The various files in the Source directory <em>must</em> be available to the
application when it runs, so do <em>not</em> move it to a location that might
not be available. (For example, avoid external hard disks or flash memory
drives.)</p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L318">4 Notes<a name="A4"></a></h3>
<p>You may want to keep notes for a variety of reasons. For example, you may
want to note text variants for each verse. Alternatively, you may want to make
exegetical or critical notes against a verse as you investigate it. Bible
Reader allows you to do this.</p>

<p>Note that the notes area is not a word processor: it provides very limited
formatting capability. One important feature it does provide is the ability to
enter Greek text as well as your normal text. Simply click on the <strong>Show
Keyboard</strong> button and a simple Greek keyboard will be displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="006 Greek Keyboard.png" width="561" height="200" /></p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L336">4.1 The Keyboard<a name="A4_1"></a></h4>

<p>This keyboard is used for both the creation of notes and entering details
into the search criteria. Because of this, you can change the target location
of anything you type. This explains the <em><strong>Radio Buttons</strong></em>
to the right of the keyboard. Make sure the option <strong>Notes
Editor</strong>, is selected when using it to enter notes:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="007 Entering Greek in Notes.png" width="1105" height="373"
/></p>

<p>Note that, while the keyboard is displayed, the button that displayed it has
changed to <strong>Hide Keyboard</strong>.</p>

<p>In practice, a lot of the time you may enter Greek text by cutting and
pasting from the main text. Using the virtual keyboard allows you greater freedom in
entering information about Greek. Note that the accents and diacritics on the
right side of the keyboard are entered after the letter to which they are
attached. In other words, to type &#x1f24;, first type eta (&eta;), then the
breathing, then the accent. If you are not sure which symbol is which, simply
hover the mouse over the key and a description of the key will be displayed for
a short time.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L357">4.2 Menu Options<a name="A4_2"></a></h4>

<p>(We shall refer to a set of notes as a <em><strong>Notes Set</strong></em>.
You can have multiple Notes Sets but you will only be able to access one Notes
Set at a time.) You can change the Notes Set that you use in the following
ways:</p>

<h5 class="style1">4.2.1 <em><strong>Create a New Notes Set<a name="A4_2_1"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>From the main menu at the top of the screen, select:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>File | Manage Notes | Create a New Notes Set</strong></p>

<p>When you select this option, the following dialog will be displayed:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="010 Create New Notes Set.png" width="516" height="213"
/></p>

<p>Provide a name for your new Notes Set. For example, MyComments.</p>

<p>This name will be used as the basis for the name of the file in which your
notes will be saved, so it is recommended that you avoid using spaces. Any new
notes you create in this Notes Set will be saved in a file with the same name
and with the extension <em>.note</em>.</p>

<p>When you restart Bible Reader, the application will reload the notes set
that you were using at the end of your previous session. For example, if you
created a new Note Set called MyComments, the notes will be saved in a file
called <em><strong>MyComments.note</strong></em>.</p>

<h5 class="style1">4.2.2 <em><strong>Choose a different Notes Set<a name="A4_2_2"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>You can change to a different, existing Notes Set by selecting the menu
option:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>File | Manage Notes |Choose a different Notes Set</strong></p>

<p>This will open the following dialog:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="011 Change Notes Set.png" width="487" height="203" /></p>

<p>Note the small down arrow to the right of the text entry box. By clicking on
this you will see a list of all available Notes Sets. Select the Set to which
you want to change and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

<h5 class="style1">4.2.3 <em><strong>Delete an Existing Notes Set<a name="A4_2_3"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>If you want to remove a Notes Set from the system, select the following from
the main menu:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>File | Manage Notes | Delet an existing Notes Set</strong></p>

<p>This will open a dialog that is identical to that of §4.2.2. The only
difference is that the current Notes Set will not be in the list available.
This is because you cannot delete the Notes Set currently in use.</p>

<p>Please note that this action is irrevocable: once a Notes Set has been
deleted, you cannot recover it.</p>

<h5 class="style1">4.2.4 <em><strong>Reminding you of the Name of your current Notes
Set<a name="A4_2_4"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>The final menu option under this heading simply displays the current Notes
Set name. It doesn't actually change anything.</p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L448">5. The Grammatical Summary<a name="A5"></a></h3>

<p>To parse a word, right click on the word of interest and then select <strong>Analyse Word</strong> from the menu that pops up.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="012 Parse example.png" width="1206" /></p>

<p>If you have previously changed to the <strong>Lexical Information</strong> or
<strong>Search Results</strong> window, selecting the Analyse button should
switch the top right pane back to the <strong>Grammatical Summary</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L469">6. Lexical Information<a name="A6"></a></h3>

<h4 class="style1" id="L471">6.1 The Main Tool<a name="A6_1"></a></h4>

<p>This is used in tandem with the Grammatical Summary facility. In other
words, Analyse means both parse the word and obtain lexicon information, if
possible. You will always have to switch to the Lexical Information pane to see
the meaning of the selected word:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="013 Lexical Information.png" width="1206" /></p>

<p>We have tried our best to ensure that a meaning for all words has been
provided but the root form identified by James Tauber is not always that
identified in Liddell &amp; Scott. Please note also that the edition of the
lexicon in the public domain (and, hence, used in Bible Reader) is fairly old
and modern criticism may throw the provided meanings of some of the less well
used words into question.</p>

<p>It would be helpful to advise us where lexical information is in error or
missing.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L482">6.2 Appendices<a name="A6_2"></a></h4>

<p>You will note from the tab in the lower right-hand pane that we have
provided the Appendices to Liddell &amp; Scott's lexicon in separate pages. The
particular value is that these are referred to in the body of the lexicon in
abbreviated form and you can check for the expanded meaning in the Appendices.
Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no facility for searching the Appendices
for a given abbreviation.</p>

<p>The Appendices are broken into the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authors and Works</li>
  <li>Epigraphical Publications</li>
  <li>Papyrological Publications</li>
  <li>Periodicals</li>
  <li>General Abbreviations</li>
</ul>

<p>These are as provided by Liddell &amp; Scott.</p>

<p>You will see that these can be selected using the tabs at the bottom of the
pane:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="014 LS Appendices.png" width="687" height="395" /></p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L511">7. Search<a name="A7"></a></h3>

<p>Clicking on the Search tab on the top of the lower right pane will reveal
the entry panel for the search facilty:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="015 Search.png" width="684" height="354" /></p>

<p>This is the simple search facility and we shall discuss more advanced
features later.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L520">7.1 Performing a Simple Search<a name="A7_1"></a></h4>

<p>The purpose of the simple search feature is to supply a word (in the
<em>Search for a word</em> box) and search for all occurrences of the word in
the New Testament.</p>

<p>There are two ways of entering suitable words in the <em>Search for a
word</em> box:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can select and copy a word in the main text area and then paste it
    into the box, or</li>
  <li>You can open the keyboard (by clicking on the <strong>Show
    Keyboard</strong> button), select the target area as &quot;Primary Search String&quot; and type the word in manually. A word of warning: NTReader can only find the selected word if it exists in the New Testament either:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>exactly as typed, or</li>
  <li>if you have typed the root of the desired word</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, text typed into the Search fields manually may result in no matches. 	</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 class="style1">7.1.1 <em><strong>Using Copy and Paste<a name="A7_1_1"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>This is probably the easier method and is likely to be the means that you
will use. There are three ways in which you can do this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a word in the main text area and then right click on the selected
    word (i.e. click once on the right button of your mouse). You should then
    see a small pop-up menu that includes various <strong>Copy</strong> options.
    Click on the  <strong>Copy Current Word to ... | Memory </strong> (i.e. single click with the left mouse
    button). Now move your mouse to the <em>Search for a word box</em> and
    click in the box (using the left mouse button). Once your cursor is
    positioned in the box, right click (click the right mouse button once) and
    select the <strong>Paste</strong> option.</li>
  <li>Select a word in the main text area and then, while holding down the
    <strong>Control</strong> key (<strong>Ctrl</strong>), press the
    key <strong>C</strong>. Now move to the <strong>Search</strong> panel and
    click your mouse in the <em>Search for a word</em> box. Once your cursor is
    positioned in the box, hold down the <strong>Control</strong> key again and
    press the key <strong>V</strong>.</li>
  <li>Right clickon the word in the main text area (as in option 1) and then select<strong> Set Search Details | Copy Current Word to Search</strong>  from the pop-up menu.</li>
</ol>

<h5 class="style1">7.1.2 <em><strong>Using the on-screen Keyboard<a name="A7_1_2"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>If the keyboard is not already visible, click on the Show Keyboard button.
The following Keyboard panel should rise at the bottom of the left-hand
side:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="006 Greek Keyboard.png" width="561" height="200" /></p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Main Search Text</strong> Radio Button to make sure
that anything you type goes into the right place. Then type your Greek word.</p>

<p>If a vowel has a breathing, accent or other diacritic, type the naked letter
first and then each of the additional symbols. If you're not sure which key
will provide the correct symbol, simply hover the mouse over the key briefly
and a description of the key should appear.</p>

<h5 class="style1">7.1.3 <em><strong>Acting on the Provided Word<a name="A7_1_3"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>Once you have entered a word in the <em>Search for a word</em> box, click on
the <strong>Search</strong> button (at the left side of the panel). This should
open the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane at the top right of the window
and display the results of the search. Be patient: it could take a little
time.</p>

<p>Note: by default, you can enter any form of a given word and it will search
for all occurrences of the root word, no matter what form it takes. So, a
search for &kappa;&tau;&#x1f77;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf; (for example)
will also return verses containing &kappa;&tau;&#x1f77;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;,
&kappa;&tau;&#x1f77;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;, and so on.</p>

<p>If you want to search for a specific form of the word (e.g.
&kappa;&tau;&#x1f77;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf; and only
&kappa;&tau;&#x1f77;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;), then change the Radio
Button on the <strong>Search</strong> pane to <strong>Exact match</strong>.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L638">7.2 The Advanced Search<a name="A7_2"></a></h4>

<p>Click on the Advanced Search button (on the Search pane - bottom right) and
additional details will appear in the pane:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="017 Advanced Search.png" width="898" height="402" /></p>

<p>We have called the text box following the words "words of", the Secondary
Search Text. You enter a word here in much the same way as before using either
1 or 2 of §7.1.1 or the virtual keyboard (§7.1.2) with the Radio Button changed
to Secondary Search Text. The Radio Button options on the right-hand search
pane function much as before.</p>

<p>So, the point of the advanced search is that you can limit the search
results to the occurrences of a word that occurs within the context of a second
word.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L649">7.3 What else can you do with search results?<a name="A7_3"></a></h4>

<h5 class="style1">7.3.1 <em><strong>Clicking on a Search Result<a name="A7_3_1"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>If you click on a specific <strong>Search Result</strong>, the main text
will take you directly to that Book and Chapter.</p>

<h5 class="style1">7.3.2 <em><strong>Copying the Search
Results<a name="A7_3_2"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>Selecting the following main menu option:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit |  Search and Results | Copy Selected Search Result | Memory</strong> (or Notes) </p>

<p>will copy the full contents of your <strong>Search Results</strong> into
memory. You can then paste this into your Word Processor or other application
of choice. Alternatively, you can right click on the relevant Search Result and select the relevant option from the pop-up menu. </p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L679">8 Adjusting the right-hand Pane<a name="A8"></a></h3>

<p>The one control on the top tool bar that we haven't discussed is the
pull-down list on the extreme right:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="018 Resize Panes.png" width="737" height="148" /></p>

<p>The purpose of this feature is to enable you to easily manage the
information in the various sections on the right-hand side of the application.
Sometimes you may want to concentrate on information in the top panel (e.g.
Search Results) and at other times you may want to focus on the lower panel
(e.g. if creating a complex note). This feature will enable you to resize these
sub-panels in a controlled fashion.</p>

<p>The options availabel are:</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L690">8.1 Minimise Bottom<a name="A8_1"></a></h4>

<p>In other words, reduce the bottom panel to an absolute minimum and allow you
to focus on the top panel. To use this option, simply click on the down arrow
beside the Resize control and select the <strong>Minimise Bottom</strong>
option:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="019 Resize with Bottom Minimised.png" width="826"
height="906" /></p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L700">8.2 Minimise Top<a name="A8_2"></a></h4>

<p>This has a similar effect but works in the other direction.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L704">8.3 Equalise Both<a name="A8_3"></a></h4>

<p>This will restore the dividing bar between the two sub-panels to the
mid-point vertically. This means that both the top and bottom panel on the
right hand side will be roughly the same size.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You are still able to resize these panels manually by clicking on the
<strong>Splitter Bar</strong> and dragging it into the desired position:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="020 Splitter Bar.png" width="683" height="217" /></p>

<h3 class="style1" id="L718">9. Main Menu Options<a name="A9"></a></h3>

<p>In this section we will outline the various Menu Options. Where we have
already discussed an option, we shall refer you to that section. Note that some
of the menu options are provided by Apple and are not under the control of the
application. We shall only discuss those that are specific to Bible Reader.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L722">9.1 Manage File Locations<a name="A9_1"></a></h4>

<p>The option for relocating key files (all Source data, Notes and Help) is found on the main menu:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>File | Change Location of Application Files</strong></p>

<p>This feature was discussed in §3.3.</p>

<h4 class="style1"><strong>9.2 Manage Notes<a name="A9_2"></a></strong></h4>
<p>All options for managing notes were discussed in §4.2.</p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L740">9.3 Copying the Bible Text<a name="A9_3"></a></h4>

<h5 class="style1">9.3.1 <em><strong>Copying the whole of the current Chapter<a name="A9_3_1"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>You can copy the contents of the whole of the current chapter to the
pasteboard from the main menu using the following sequence of options:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Bible Text | Copy Current Chapter to ... </strong></p>

<p>This provides to final possible destinations for the copy process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Memory - i.e. to the clipboard, so it can be inserted into <em>any</em> text-based application using the <strong>paste</strong> option</li>
  <li>Notes - so that the selection is copied directly into the currently open notes page. </li>
</ul>
<p>If copying to memory, once the copy process has been completed, you will be notified by a simple
  alert. The text can subsequently be pasted into any application of your choice
  that allows you to do so (e.g. a Word Processor).</p>
<p>If copying to notes, the selected text will be inserted at the current cursor position. </p>
<p>Of course, you can also perform a copy manually by selecting all the text in
the window and then using the <strong>Copy</strong> facility.</p>

<h5 class="style1">9.3.2 <em><strong>Copying the Current Verse<a name="A9_3_2"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>This will copy the verse from the main text area in which the fine cursor
(or Caret) is positioned. To do this select:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Bible Text | Copy Current Verse</strong> <strong>to ...</strong> </p>

<p>This functions in much the same way as copying a chapter (see §9.3.1)</p>

<h5 class="style1">9.3.3 <em><strong>Copying the current Word<a name="A9_3_3"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>This copy process is similar to the previous two but is very specific and
will copy a single word. To do this use:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Bible Text | Copy Current Word to ...</strong> </p>

<p>This functions in much the same way as copying a chapter (see &sect;9.3.1)</p>

<h5 class="style1">9.3.4 <em><strong>Copying the current Word to the
Search Text Field<a name="A9_3_4"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>To do this, use:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Search and Results| Copy
Word to Primary Search</strong></p>

<p>Selecting this option will copy the current word directly to the main search
text field in the Search panel:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="021 Copy word to Search.png" width="694" height="353" /></p>
<p align="left">If the Search pane is not already visible, using this option will insert the selected word and make the search option visible. </p>
<h5 class="style1">9.3.5 <em><strong>Copying the Current Word to the Secondary Search Text
  Field<a name="A9_3_5"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>To do this, use:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Search and Results| Copy
  Word to Secondary Search</strong></p>
<p>This will
  copy the current word to the secondary text field:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="022 Copy to Secondary Text Field.png" width="695"
height="354" /></p>
<p align="left">If the Secondary search option is not currently visible, this will make it visible and active. </p>
<h4 id="L820"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">9.4 Copying
Text from the Grammatical Summary and Lexical Information Panels<a name="A9_4"></a></span></h4>

<h5 class="style1">9.4.1 <em><strong>Copying the Grammatical Summary<a name="A9_4_1"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>The whole of the current Grammatical Summary will be copied to the
pasteboard using the menu options:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Handle Analysis | Copy Grammatical Summary to ...</strong> </p>

<p>As described in  &sect;9.3.1, the final choice in this menu option will be to either copy the selection to the clipboard (available for pasting into any text-based application) or directly into the current note.</p>

<h5 class="style1">9.4.2 <em><strong>Copying the Lexical Information<a name="A9_4_2"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>The whole of the Lexical Information text can be copied in much the same way
as §9.4.1 using:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Handle Analysis | Copy Lexical Summary to ...</strong></p>

<h5 class="style1">9.4.3 <em><strong>Copying both the Grammatical Summary and the Lexical
Information<a name="A9_4_3"></a></strong></em></h5>
<p>Both the above sections can be copyied at the same time using this option.
Select:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Handle Analysis | Copy Both to ... </strong></p>

<h4 class="style1" id="L855">9.5 Copying Search Results<a name="A9_5"></a></h4>

<p>The full results of a search can be copied to the pasteboard or current note (as described in &sect;9.3.1). Use</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Search and Results | Copy All Search Results </strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Edit | Search and Results | Copy Selected Search Results </strong></p>
<p>The first option will copy all the results for the current search; the second will copy only the result in which the cursor is currently located. </p>
<h4 class="style1" id="L862">9.6 Changing Text Sizes and Colour and Panel Background
Colour<a name="A9_6"></a></h4>

<p>You can change the font size and text colour separately for each of the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main text area</li>
  <li>The Grammatical Summary</li>
  <li>The Lexical Information</li>
  <li>Search Results</li>
  <li>Notes</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also change the colour of the background in each of these areas. </p>

<p>You may want to use a larger font size if you find the text a little
difficult to read. Equally, you may want to reduce the font size to fit more
into the space available.</p>

<p>The ability to change text and background colours may simply satisfy your
esthetic preferences but also some people with reading difficulties find that
changing these colours in a controlled way can make reading easier.</p>

<p>All three types of change are controlled by a single menu option:</p>

<p align="center"><strong>File | Preferences </strong></p>

<p>This will open the <strong>Font Management</strong> dialog:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" src="023 Font Management.png" width="681" height="208" /></p>

<p>Attributes for each panel can be accessed separately by clicking on the
relevant radio button at the left of the dialog.</p>

<p>A list of standard font sizes is provided in the pull-down list for the
fonts but you can enter any sensible value (including fractional font sizes).
The colours can be selected using one of a number of colour selection tools.</p>

<p>Clicking on <strong>OK</strong> will close the dialog and activate any
changes you have made for all of the five areas. Clicking on
<strong>Cancel</strong> will return you to the main application without making
any changes and any changes that you made in the dialog will be lost.</p>

<p>Any changes that you make will be saved and, next time you start the
application, these changes will be retained.</p>
