# GreekBibleStudent_for_Windows
Greek Bible Student provides the following utilities in a single application:
a) the text of the NT and the Septuagint (Ralfs edition);
b) grammatical analysis (parsing) of any selected word;
c) Liddel & Scott (Intermediate) lexicon entries for the selected word;
d) search capability (in effect, a Greek concordance), with some additional sophistication;
e) the ability to create word lists for individual verses or whole chapters;
f) a utility for capturing notes on a verse-by-verse basis.

The application runs on your local computer.  As a result, it does not depend on you having access to the Internet (other than the initial download) and will only be limited by the speed of your processor (and not the speed of your Internet connection).

The software is provided for Windows (both 64-bit and 32-bit versions) and MAC OS X.  You can find the MAC software in a seperate repository.

In each case, simple installation files and Visual Studio-ready source code is provided in seperate directories.  Note that the Windows source code is in C#.

Where suitable, additional readme files have been placed in lower directories, at strategic levels.
